# Gaggantikaay
This project is sostained by senegalese association named Akaademi wolof.
the main gol is to build a complete online multilingual dictionary.
I and other members of the association mainly build the application and the web site
the other member inserts word's translations from.

# WHY THIS PROJECT:

There isn't a very large wolof mutiligual dictionary project where wolof words' descriptions are written entirly in wolof. 
So in this project we would like to create the biggest online repository of wolof words, translate wolof words in wolof and in other languages
